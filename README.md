# Layered Graph Drawings with Few Crossings and Few Gaps Implementation

## Algorithms

Algorithms for crossing minimization can found under `/crossing_minimization`.
Alorithms of interest are `ThesisMedianSorter`, `ThesisBarycenterSorter` and `GurobiSorter`.

## Graph Implementation

The implementation for the graph datastructure used can be found in `multilayered_graph/multilayered_graph.py`.

## Experiments

`thesis_experiments/` contains code used to benchmark the algorithms and perform the case study.
